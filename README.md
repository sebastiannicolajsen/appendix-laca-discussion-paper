# Towards an Approach for using LLMs for Content Analysis

This repository contains the necessary documentation for conducting the analysis explained in the paper of the same name.

The goal of this example, is to apply **L**LM **A**ssisted **C**ontent **A**nalysis (LACA) with the goal of extending the work by Simon & Sheard [1], building on the work by Simon [2]. In particular, they categorised computing education research papers to provide valuable insights for potential authors, attendees, chairs, and the whole computing education community. Our goal here is not to complete the entire analysis, but rather focus on illustrating the usefulness of LACA, by focusing on identifying the themes (part of Simon's system) in a much wider data set of computing education research papers. We refer to the paper for the specifics of the example, and use this as a resource to. share the things which there was in the actual paper.

## Complete dataset

Refer to specific file of complete data set and show overview table

### Sample data

Refer to subset which was coded, and how we would add human codes to that

## Codebook

The codebook used for the human-human part, report this here and explain the difference from prompt

## LLM workflow

Refer to the files for doing the comparison (in code), and the entire analysis. Also include the visual project.

Describe aitomics/aitomics-ui in brief, and explain how a python port is underway.

### Prompt

Describe the prompt and how it differs
