Given the course objectives, determine which of the following themes are covered by the course. The theme of a paper is what the paper is about, and is not to be confused with its context. A paper in the context of a formal methods course might be about how the course is taught, or about a tool to assist with assessment in the course, or about gender issues in the course, and so on; these would be the themes of these papers.Some papers do not have a single clear theme: a paper might be about the introduction of a flipped classroom and its impact on female students; its theme might then be either teaching/learning techniques or gender issues. Reply with only the themes that are covered by the course, separated by underscore (_):

"Teaching/learning techniques", "Teaching/learning tools",  "Curriculum",  "Ability/aptitude/understanding", "Assessment tools",    "Assessment techniques", "Teaching/learning theories & models", "Recruitment, progression, pathways", "Online/distance delivery",    "Educational technology",  "Gender issues"
